/**
 * @fileoverview Passport-gated validation strategy for Snapshot. 
 * This implementation integrates with the Gitcoin API to validate 
 * whether a user is authorized to vote on a proposal. 
 * 
 * Last modified: May 11, 2023
 * 
 * NOTE: The original code used the Passport SDK to check if the user
 * has a valid passport. With the Passport API, we can simply check if
 * the user has a valid passport by looking for a score.
 * 
 * In this function, we are returning a binary score (0 or 1) depending
 * on wether the user's passport is flagged as a likely Sybil.
