# Gitcoin Passport Gated Validation

This repository provides a passport-gated validation strategy for Snapshot. The implementation integrates with the Gitcoin API to validate whether a user is authorized to vote on a proposal.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, ensure that you have the following information stored in a `.env` file at the project root:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GC_API_KEY=<your-api-key>`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GC_SCORER_ID=<your-scorer-id>`


## Overview

This implementation checks whether a user has a valid passport by utilizing the Gitcoin API. Instead of using the Passport SDK, we can now check for a user's valid passport by looking for a score.

## Code Explanation

The main function in this codebase returns a binary score (0 or 1) based on whether the user's passport is flagged as a likely Sybil.

## Modifications

The original code utilized the Passport SDK to check if the user has a valid passport. However, with the introduction of the Passport API, we can now simplify the process by checking for a score.

## Last Modified

Feel free to customize and extend this implementation to suit your specific needs.

Please make sure to keep your API key and scorer ID confidential and secure.
